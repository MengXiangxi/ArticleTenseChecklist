# Article Tense Checklist

There used to be several guidelines on the internet which included some kind of a checklist, to indicate which tense is to be used in a specific situation. However, they sadly disappeared from the first page of Google. So I decided to build my own, and supply them with examples whenever possible.

This might be of little help to other people, as 'yet another' tense guide (see [the references](#previous_guidelines)). I mainly intend to use it as a personal reference, or a pedogogical tool.

It is worth noting that the recommendations from different guidelines are very often contradictory, and that papers published nowadays are more often to misuse the tenses than not. Thus the guidelines here only provide a consistent way to observe, thus it is not a judgemental criterion.

## Title

- Generally in **simple present tense**

## Abstract

The tense of the Abstract is basically in line with the tense use in the body of the manuscript.

- Abstract is generally in the **present tense**.

- General facts ==> **present tense** or **present perfact tense**
> The plant immune system is fundamental for plant survival in natural ecosystems and for productivity in crop fields. Substantial evidence supports the prevailing notion that plants possess a two-tiered innate immune system, called pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI).

> [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03316-6)

- Past research activities ==> **present perfect tense** or **past tense**
> Several studies have established that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than preexisting variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity.

- Introducing the subject of the research ==> **present tense**

> Here, we develop robust cell type decomposition (RCTD), a computational method that leverages cell type profiles learned from single-cell RNA-seq to decompose cell type mixtures while correcting for differences across sequencing technologies. We demonstrate the ability of RCTD to detect mixtures and identify cell types on simulated datasets. Furthermore, RCTD accurately reproduces known cell type and subtype localization patterns in Slide-seq and Visium datasets of the mouse brain. Finally, we show how RCTD’s recovery of cell type localization enables the discovery of genes within a cell type whose expression depends on spatial environment.

> *Here we report the detection by the IceCube neutrino observatory of a cascade of high-energy particles (a particle shower) consistent with being created at the Glashow resonance.* A shower with an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 PeV (determined from Cherenkov radiation in the Antarctic Ice Sheet) was measured. *Features consistent with the production of secondary muons in the particle shower indicate the hadronic decay of a resonant W− boson, confirm that the source is astrophysical and provide improved directional localization. The evidence of the Glashow resonance suggests the presence of electron antineutrinos in the astrophysical flux, while also providing further validation of the standard model of particle physics.*

## Introduction

## Methods and Materials

## Results, or the result part in Results and Discussion

## Discussions, or the discussion part in Results and Discussion

## Conclusion

## Acknoledgement and other stuff

## Reference

This section in not on the tense of the reference part of the manuscript. Rather, it lists the sources consulted during the compilation of this document. In fact, the reference part of an article does not involve the use of verbs, in general.

### Examples

Examples are taken from journals published by [Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/), and I believe that this project falls perfectly in the realm of fair use. Anyway, if a copyright concern is raised, I can subsitute the examples with sources bearing other inclusive licenses (such as BY-CC or GPL).
